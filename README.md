# Medical Insurance Cost Predictor

This project is a medical insurance cost predictor that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the cost of medical insurance based on various factors such as age, BMI, sex, smoker status, and region.

The predictor utilizes three machine learning techniques:

1. Linear Regression: This approach builds a linear relationship between the input features and the insurance cost. It provides insights into how each feature contributes to the prediction.

2. Lasso Regression: Lasso regression is a variant of linear regression that performs feature selection by applying a penalty to the model coefficients. It helps in identifying the most influential features for the insurance cost prediction.

3. Decision Tree Regression: Decision tree regression creates a model that predicts the insurance cost by recursively partitioning the data based on feature values. It captures non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable.

## Results

The trained models provide evaluation metrics on the test data, including mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R2 score. These metrics give an indication of the predictive performance of each model. The results section in the README should present the performance metrics for each model.
